# BFGAlertController

An appearance-customizable version of `UIAlertController` (Alert and Action Sheet). API should be very similar to `UIAlertController` with added methods to handle appearance customization. More thorough documentation is forthcoming, but you can look at the example project or the library for more detail.

## Installation

Will eventually be available through CocoaPods, but for now, you can import it as a development pod (there is a `BFGAlertController.podspec`). Just download and add it locally. `BFGAlertController` is written in Swift (1.2) so you will likely need to add framework support. The class should also be available to Objective-C code.

## Known Issues

There are likely some issues and quirks at this point (not well-tested, but I'm about to integrate it into one of my projects). Feel free to report or fix and submit a pull request.

## License

MIT. Have at it.
